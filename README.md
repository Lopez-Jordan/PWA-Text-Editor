## Description
For this project, I converted an application into a PWA (Progressive Web Application). In order to achieve this, I used  I installed service workers with a cache first strategy to cache all the assets--.js , .css , .html files--when first connected to the internet. On top of this, I utilized indexedDB, with CRUD operations, in order to temporarily store information when used offline. Due to my work, I also was able to get this application to a passing Light House score in order to be considered a PWA!
